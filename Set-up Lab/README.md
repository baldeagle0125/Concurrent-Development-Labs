# Set-up Lab

## Overview
Introduction to Go programming basics including mathematical functions, recursion, and functional programming concepts.

## GitHub Repository
[https://github.com/baldeagle0125/Concurrent-Development-Labs](https://github.com/baldeagle0125/Concurrent-Development-Labs)

## Features Demonstrated
- Factorial calculation using iterative approach
- Fibonacci calculation using recursion
- Higher-order functions (function as parameter)
- Lambda functions (anonymous functions)
- Slice manipulation
- User input handling

## Files
- `samples.go` - Main program demonstrating Go basics

## How to Run
```bash
cd "Set-up Lab"
go run samples.go
```

## Sample Output
```
Enter a number: 5
the factorial is:  120
the fibonacci is: 5
Enter a number: 3
the factorial is:  6
the fibonacci is: 2
Enter a number: 0
the factorial is:  0
the fibonacci is: 1
10
[1 2 3 4]
[2 3 4 5]
```

## Key Concepts
1. **Factorial Function**: Iterative calculation of N!
2. **Fibonacci Function**: Recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers
3. **applyMap Function**: Higher-order function that applies a transformation to all elements in a slice
4. **Anonymous Functions**: Demonstrates lambda functions in Go

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding Go syntax and basic data types
- Working with functions and closures
- Slice manipulation and iteration
- Input/output operations in Go
